This repository contains my submitted solutions to LeetCode problems. I had already solved 150 problems before starting this repository. From now on, all my new submissions will be added here.

## Repository Details

- Each file is named based on the problem number (e.g., `1.py` for problem 1).
- Solutions are written in various programming languages, depending on the problem requirements and my preference.

## Purpose

- Track my progress on LeetCode.
- Improve my coding and problem-solving skills.
- Maintain a collection of solutions for future reference.
